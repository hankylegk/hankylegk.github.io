I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in UCLA MSE department. My Ph.D. research are mainly focus on probing inhomogeneous superconductivity in a organic layered superconductor. At the same time, I have 4+ years experience in material processing and is now working on some side project learning the tool set Data Scientist needs.
